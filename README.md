1. List precise instructions to build and execute your system. Be sure to tell us about necessary libraries, and about any operating system or other restrictions.
2. Include any necessary details about where to store data files too.
3. Also include any other special information we need to know in order to test your system properly (a list of known bugs, for example).
**list of bugs**
* The player (survivor) can move outside the game scene
* Can't purchase the assualt soldier and money maker (each costs 50 coins) even if I still have more than 50 but less than 80 coins **That's what I noticed but not sure if it's really 80 or even higher**
* After all the zombies pass, some soldiers are still shooting but others don't
* Sometimes, the player (survivor) is shooting but there's no zombies or is not shooting but zombies are getting close **Not sure about the problems with shooting**
* Wave contains random numbers of zombies. The game looks messy when too many zombies interacts with soldiers. A certian reasonable amount of zombies must be set in each round to assure the playability.
* You can't really win or lose the game right now. Winning and losing conditions haven't been implemented yet
4. Finally include brief guidance about how to use the system (e.g., how to play the game).
