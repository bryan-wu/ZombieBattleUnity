1. List precise instructions to build and execute your system. Be sure to tell us about necessary libraries, and about any operating system or other restrictions.
2. Include any necessary details about where to store data files too.
3. Also include any other special information we need to know in order to test your system properly (a list of known bugs, for example).
**list of bugs**
* The player (survivor) can move outside the game scene
* Shop doesn't work properly in some special cases, for example: 1. Once a button for a particular type of soldiers greys out because user doesn't have enough money for that kind of soldiers, user also can't purchase other types of soldiers that user can afford. 2. Once a button is lightened because user now has enough money by collecting coins, user still can't buy those soldiers that user can afford.
* After all the zombies pass, some soldiers are still shooting but others don't
* Sometimes, the player (survivor) is shooting but there's no zombies or is not shooting but zombies are getting close **Not sure about the problems with shooting**
* You can't really win or lose the game right now. Winning and losing conditions haven't been implemented yet
4. Finally include brief guidance about how to use the system (e.g., how to play the game).
